# School-District-Analysis
Analyze state-testing standardized scores for high school and report to the school district

##Overview of the School District Analysis
    The purpose of this analysis is to make sure the school data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School is intact by replacing innacurate data. The following data to be analyzed are:  school budget, per student capita, average math scores, average reading scores, the passing percent for math, the passing percent for reading, and the overall passing percentage.
    
##Results
    Much of the data from the original analysis had little to no changes at all. The reason is that a large dataset was given with only removing a small portion of the data (the math and the reading scores).

   Even with certain data being replaced, the overall results were not affected.

##Summary
    The four major changes included the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math scores and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math scores and reading scores. The removal of data implies a decrease in the count of total students with regards to this particular high school analysis which changes average scores and score percentages.
